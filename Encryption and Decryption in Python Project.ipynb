With better encryption methods, we can better protect sensitive information—such as passwords and personal data—and ensure secure online communication. Therefore, exploring such methods as the caesar cipher and the transposition cipher would contribute towards effort to maintaining data integrity and confidentiality."

    "The caesar cipher is a simple yet effective way of encrypting a text to render it unreadable to anyone without the key to decrypting/decoding the text. It relies on substituting texts by shifting each letter in the text by a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet. Here, the caesar cipher is implemented by creating a CaesarCipher class, and creating an encryption (and decryption) method that shifts the alphabets in a text by 14 places (and returns the original text provided the text decryption key is valid).

    "The transposition cipher is another way of encrypting a text in a more secure way than the caesar cipher and also makes a text unreadable to anyone who doesn’t possess the key to decryption. It relies on scrambling the words in plaintext by rearranging its characters. While transposition ciphers come in various forms, each contributing a unique layer of complexity, in this project, I implement the columnar transposition cipher by creating a TranspositionCipher class. In this columnar transposition cipher, the characters of the parsed texts are arranged in rows while their encryption is accomplished by reading along the columns."
